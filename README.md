# Rubik's Cube

## Description

A small project I started to better understand and visualize the process of solving Rubik's cube.

## Controls

### Onscreen controls

Rotate respective faces with 'Front', 'Back', 'Left', 'Right', 'Up', 'Down' buttons
Tick 'Counterclockwise' box to rotate counterclockwise
Use 'X', 'Y', 'Z' buttons to rotate the whole cube itself on respective axis
Use 'Undo' to revert last move
Use 'Undo all' to revert all moves according to the move history
Use 'Clear history' to clear move history
Use 'Scramble' to randomize the cube
Use 'Seq' buttons to permorm predefined sequences of moves, required to solve the cube 

### Mouse

Right mouse button drag - rotate camera around the cube
Scroll wheel - zoom
Middle mouse button click - reset camera

## Features

- Faces rotations are relative to the camera
- Scramble functionality
- History of moves with 'Undo', 'Undo all' and 'Clear history' functionality
- Predefined sequences of moves

## Features to implement

- Add solving guide
- Add descriptions for each of the sequences
- Add keyboard input
